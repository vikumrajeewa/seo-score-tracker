## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A WordPress website hosted online.
- A Google Analytics account with the tracking code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the steps in this guide to set up and configure analytics tracking on your WordPress website.

## 1. Tracking Scroll Depth Percentage

To track scroll depth percentage using Google Analytics:

1. Open the `functions.js` file in your theme's JavaScript directory (`wp-content/themes/your-theme/js/functions.js`).

2. Add the provided JavaScript code for tracking scroll depth in `functions.js`.

3. Ensure that you've included the Google Analytics tracking code in the `<head>` section of your theme's `header.php` file.

4. Save your changes and upload the modified `functions.js` file to your WordPress theme directory.

5. Verify that scroll depth events are being recorded in your Google Analytics account.

## 2. Tracking New Session Percentage

To track new session percentage using Google Analytics:

1. Ensure that you have Google Analytics set up and correctly integrated with your website.

2. In your Google Analytics account, navigate to "Audience" > "Overview" to view the new session percentage.

## 3. Tracking Like Count Percentage

To track like count percentage:

1. Create a mechanism for users to like or interact positively with your content.

2. Implement custom code or use a plugin to calculate the like count percentage for each post.

3. Store the like count percentage as a custom field for each post in WordPress.

4. Modify your `single.php` file to display the like count percentage using the `get_post_meta()` function.

## Displaying Analytics Data

- Open your `single.php` file and include code blocks to display the scroll depth percentage, new session percentage, and like count percentage as described in the README.

- Customize the appearance and location of these percentages to suit your website's design.
